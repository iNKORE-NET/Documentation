## Step 2: Start MCSkinn

### Preparations

Before using MCSkinn, you need a directory (a.k.a. a given folder) representing your skin library. It can be empty or filled with your personal skins. All your skins designs will be in this directory. If you want to create a skin from zero, just create an empty one. If you'd like to edit skins downloaded from the Internet, you need to move (or copy) the skins to that directory. MCSkinn cannot view or edit skins that are outside this directory.

### Open app and first initialization

After everything is ready, you should be able to see MCSkinn shortcut in the start menu and desktop. Click it to start the app.

![Start MCSkinn in start menu](start-mcskinn-in-start-menu.png)

If you're the first time using MCSkinn on this computer, you will see this message:

![The first run of MCSkinn](mcskinn-first-run.png)

It's time to add your skin directory! Click **Yes**, and select the directory you've prepared.

Now everything is set. You can start working immediately or continue reading more about how to use MCSkinn!
