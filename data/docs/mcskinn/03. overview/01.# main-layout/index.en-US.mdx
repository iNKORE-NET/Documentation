## Skin libraries

**Skin directory navigation**: Select which skin directory you want to go to if you have multiple skin directories. You can also go to Sponsor, Settings and About page.

**Skin list**: Select and manage your skin in a tree structure and head thumbnails. You can drag and drop the selected skin internally, and right click a skin to open its context menu.

## Editor

**Viewport**: The main area for viewing, moving and editing your skins. Different mouse buttons work differently in different tools.

**Select Tools**: Many tools you can choose from. You can also take a screenshot, reset camera here. The tools will be introduced later.

**Models Selector**: Click to select the right model that fits to your skin, then a categorized menu will be open for you to select.

**View Modes**: Switch to 3D/2D/Split view freely for your viewport. This helps a lot editing your skin.

## Toolbar & Menus

**Undo & Save**: Undo, redo, or save your skin in one click. You can click the small arrow after the button to undo/redo multiple steps. You can also right click the save button to save the skin as.

**Tip & Status Bar**: Displays some hint information and current status of the program. When you're confused, the tip may help.

## Sidebars

**Tool Options**: Change brush shape, density and other options for the selected tool. Using the tools wisely helps you design your skin faster.

**Toggle Parts**: Set the skin part should be visible or not. Use the checkbox to toggle its visibility. This helps when you want to see some faces that are hidden normally.

**Color Editor**: Change the color of the current tool using the palette, HEX box and RGB/HSL/HSV sliders.

**Scene**: Change the background environment in viewport in order to view your skin with different game-like effects directly.
