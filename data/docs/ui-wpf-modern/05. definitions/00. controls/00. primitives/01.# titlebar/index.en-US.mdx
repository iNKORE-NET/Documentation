- Property: Attached | Readonly

- Type: `double`

### [Close/Minimize/Maximize]-ButtonAvailability

There are three buttons located in the title bar by default: minimize, maximize/restore, and close. You can customize these buttons by using the three properties in **ui:TitleBar** class as well:

- **ui:TitleBar.CloseButtonAvailability**: The availability of the close button.

- **ui:TitleBar.MaximizeButtonAvailability**: The availability of the maximize/restore button.

- **ui:TitleBar.MinimizeButtonAvailability**: The availability of the minimize button.

As the word 'availability' means, you can control the visibility and enabled status of the buttons with these properties. You can choose one option from [TitleBarButtonAvailability Enum](%BASE_NAME%/definitions/controls/primitives/titlebar-button-availability).

:::warning Be careful when you hide the close button.

You can surely disable or hide the close button. But users can still close your window by pressing Alt+F4, using the task manager, clicking the close button on the taskbar or other methods.

If you really wish your window to be unclosable, you should consider handling the **Window.Closing** event after disabling the close button, and cancel the closing operation by setting **Cancel** property of **CancelEventArgs** to **true**.

:::

For example, the following code will hide the minimize button and disable the close button:

```ini
ui:TitleBar.ButtonMinimizeAvailability="Collapsed"
ui:TitleBar.ButtonCloseAvailability="Disabled"
```

![Window with hidden minimize button and disabled close button](hidden-minimize-and-disable-close.png)

:::warning Never hide only one of minimize button and maximize/restore button.

The example above is just for demonstration. Do not imitate it in your applications. According to the Fluent Design guidelines, you should always show both minimize and maximize/restore buttons together. If you hide one of them, the other one should be hidden as well.

Though we give you the full rights to customize your applications, it's not recommended since it might confuse users and break the consistency of the UI.

:::

- Property: Attached

- Type: [TitleBarButtonAvailability](%BASE_NAME%/definitions/controls/primitives/titlebar-button-availability)

- Default value: `Auto`

### ButtonGlyphStyle

The button is disabled but visible. You can still see the button but cannot interact with it. You can choose from [TitleBarButtonGlyphStyle Enum](%BASE_NAME%/definitions/controls/primitives/titlebar-button-glyph-style).

The null value means the style will be selected automatically based on the system.

- Property: Attached

- Type: [TitleBarButtonGlyphStyle](%BASE_NAME%/definitions/controls/primitives/titlebar-button-glyph-style)?

- Default value: `null`
