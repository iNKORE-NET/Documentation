# Introduction

As Windows application development continues to evolve, developers have been continuously seeking solutions that make their applications both aesthetically pleasing and modern. Traditional Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) has become the cornerstone of many desktop applications, providing powerful functionality and flexibility. However, with shifts in user interface design trends, particularly with the introduction of Microsoft's Fluent Design system, developers have been in dire need of a method to implement modern design aesthetics without moving to a new framework.

iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern is an innovative UI library for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications, designed to emulate the sleek and modern aesthetics of the Fluent Design system found in WinUI. This library enables developers to enhance their WPF applications with a contemporary look and feel, without the dependencies on WinUI or UWP frameworks, ensuring full compatibility even with older operating systems like Windows 7.

## Key Features

:::tip Reminder

This library has an optional reference to WinMD libraries, in order to get the system theme color, schemes and some other settings.
In Windows 10 1809 and older versions, the theme can't be auto-detected and will apply the default settings. You can always customize them if you want.
